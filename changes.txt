Behavior Changes Compare to ffigen4
===================================

1. Builtin macro definition changes from gcc's to clang's.

2. Builtin macro definition is in `""` file instead of line 1 of given header file.

3. Ignore all `#undef` since libclang doesn't give me access to it and luckily `parse-ffi.lisp` doesn't make use of `undef-macro`.

4. Function pointer type is not exposed by libclang, have to use `void *` instead.
